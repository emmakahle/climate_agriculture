       "         We do not feed any grain, antibiotics, growth hormones or  steroids. If an occasional animal needs an antibiotic, it is identified and not  marketed through our normal program. Wormers and pesticides for flies and lice  are seldom used. <br/><br/>\n",
       "         You can buy a whole, half or quarter. You can also buy  individual cuts that are double paper wrapped and frozen. All harvesting,  aging, cutting and wrapping is done under the watchful eyes of USDA inspectors.<br/><br/>\n",

       "         Because our soils are mostly peat in a frequently flooded  valley, we must keep our cattle in a large confinement area in the winter to  protect water quality and salmon habitat and to reduce field pugging. Our grass  and clover hay and silage are fed at these times. <br/><br/>\n",

The gardens  provide a wide variety of fresh produce as well as seasonal berries. The farm  is shared with two Highland cows, forty laying hens, two gentleman horses,  thousands of busy honey bees and Sam, our Shepherd. We have veggies, berries (strawberries, raspberries,  blueberries and blackberries) apples, flowers, <strong>eggs</strong> and hopefully this year our  first batch of honey.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"bodyMargin\">We use sustainable practices and our \"girls\" are on pasture except  for at night. Then they are enclosed in a quarter-acre fenced yard with a coop so  they have access to the outdoors all the time. Unlike some bee keepers, we do not  feed our bees high fructose corn syrup. They are kept on their own honey over  the winter which is why we had none our first year.</p>,\n",

Our land lies along the Elwha River, a resource that has for  centuries fed the people of this area. The name Wild Edge Farm comes from  our belief that today, more than ever, nurtured wild edges are an essential  ingredient for health and well-being. By managing grazing and leaving  edges, our pastures maintain diversity and improve soil health, allowing us to  offer grass fed <strong>beef</strong> and <strong>pork</strong> that is nutrient dense from animals   raised with care.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"bodyMargin\">We practice regenerative  agriculture, focusing on soil life by minimizing tillage, and utilizing cover  crops, bio-char, multi-species grazing, and crop rotation. By integrating  animal agriculture with our vegetable production we improve soil health while  increasing the nutrient density of our vegetables. Our heritage breed Tamworth  hogs are raised outdoors year round on the farm. Our beef is 100% grass fed,  moved daily to maximize nutrition. The flash grazing of beef followed by  pigs and chickens limits disturbance and distributes nutrients to the pasture  grasses. </p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"bodyMargin\">We sell beef and pork shares,  as well as quarter, half and whole animals. Sign up is year round. We supply meat and vegetables locally at the <em>Port Angeles Farmers’ Market</em> and  through the Farm to Food Pantry program. Our 20 week CSA runs from mid-June  to early November.</p>,\n",
