# climate_agriculture
How does a changing climate impact agricultural practices?

This repo will house my project to explore the intersection between climate change and agriculture. My goals with this project are the following:

1) Explore what data sets exist about climate change and farming practices; use what I find to focus the scope of this project.
2) Create and manage a SQL database to store the data that I find.
3) Use a Jupyter notebook to find patterns in the data.
4) Create a dashboard to visualize interesting aspects of the data.
5) Model the data to understand what agricultural practices lead to successful outcomes.
6) Develop a deliverable product that can be used by farmers to access the insights of this project.
